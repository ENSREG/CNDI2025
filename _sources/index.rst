Welcome to Open-Source Core Network Design and Implementation 2025!
==================================================

This course is designed to train professionals in communications network programming. The core network plays an indispensable role in communications networks, and developing network components demands ex-tensive domain knowledge (software-defined networking, containerization, network programming). This course covers the aforementioned technologies in a clear, approachable manner, guiding students through the development and application of core networks.
The course centers on the open-source software free5GC and is supplemented by other open-source tools such as Kubernetes, Docker, UERAMSIM, ONF Aether, Nephio, and LoxiLB. free5GC is a core-network open-source project led by Professor Jyh-Cheng Chen and, as of September 16, 2024, is part of the Linux Foundationâ€™s global open-source leadership organization.
